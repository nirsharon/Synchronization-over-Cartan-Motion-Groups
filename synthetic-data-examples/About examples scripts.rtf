How to reconstruct the figures of synthetic data examples:
Figure~3: Missing data and noise, with LS: use runFiguresMissingData_V1.m. Thanks to ManOpt.org for the complementary code
Figure~4: Outliers and noise: runFiguresOutliers.m. Thanks to the code of l1 minimization by Nathan D. Cahill.
Figure~5: MATRIX MOTION GROUP: test_SyncMMG_cleaner.m (need to choose the right scenario)
